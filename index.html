                A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are
                securely linked
                together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4] </sup>Each block contains a cryptographic hash of
                the previous block,
                a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
                represented by lea
                ves). Since each block contains information about
                the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each a
                dditional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in
                that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteri
                ng all subsequent <del>blocks</del>sets. <br>

    Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
    computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where
    nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add
    and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records
    are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and
    exemplify a distributed
    computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup><br>

    A blockchain was created by a person <cod>(or group of people) </cod>using
    the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the
    public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions,
    based on previous work by Stuart Haber, <emp>W. Scott Stornetta</emp>, and
    Dave Bayer.<sup>[6]</sup> The implementation of the blockchain within
    bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
    double-spending problem
    without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
    The bitcoin design has inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup> and blockchains that are readable by the public
    and are widely used by cryptocurrencies.
    The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[7]</sup>

        <proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982
            dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups." <sup>
            [10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was
            described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a
            system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992,
            Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by
            allowing several document certificates to be
            collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their
            company Surety,
            their document certificate hashes have been published in<i>The New York Times </i> every week since
            1995.[13]

            The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people)
            known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like
            method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a
            difficulty parameter to stabilize the
            rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as
            a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin,
            where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]

            In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions
            that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size
            had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew
            from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]

            The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were
            eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]

            According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that
            blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching
            the early adopters' phase.[17] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum
            in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks
        that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively,
        without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][20] This allows the participants to verify and audit
        transactions
        independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a
        peer-to-peer network
        and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective
        self-interests.[22]
        Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal.
        The use of a blockchain
        removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value
        was transferred only once,
        solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange
        protocol.
       <sup> [23] </sup>A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it
        provides
        a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]

        Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup></p>
       <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
       </ul>
